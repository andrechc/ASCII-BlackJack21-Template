# ASCII-BlackJack21-Template
Project that I made from scratch to create an ASCII BlackJack21 Template utilizing mapped cards that are shown side by side utilizing my own algorithm developed for MyConsoleFonts.


ASCII BlackJack21 Demonstration: 
Methods used: BlackJack.enterParaComenzar();
              Jugador.pedirCarta(); (Asks for a card, except for the first time that will always ask for 2).
              Cruiper.pedirCarta(); ( "" for the cruiper. Card nÂ°2 will always be hidden in the first hand, unless it's BlackJack).
              BlackJack.enterParaContinuar(); (Generates a void that allows the player to stand, read and think untill he presses Enter again. It also separates last move from next move with a line of "---").
